Motion passes unanimously. Item three, resident recognition of visitor input. Do we have any, nobody signed up, but we have some people in the audience that would like to speak. Please come forward to the podium, state your name, and you have three minutes. My name is Nicole Reed. I'm here to advocate for the second grade students that I have this year. This is my 10th year teacher, second grade at Perfield Elementary School. And those years I have never had or were 22 students in my classroom. Last week, those numbers went to 27. My classroom is very small. The students do not have much room to walk between deaths. I have my deaths in groups so that the students can collaborate. I now have two groups that have six students. Smaller groups are better, and second graders are collaborating. And the 10 years that I have taught at Parkview, this is the first year that I have had to have five small reading groups. Due to the number of reading groups, I have needed to have another adult help me with my reading groups. We have a grandmother who comes and helps at our school. She's helping with one of those reading groups. I am not personally getting this small group reading time with all of my students like I have in the past years. Due to having 27 students in my room, I have also struggled meeting all my students needs. I have students that struggle focusing and students that are struggling, staying on. This has come to so many students and all the extra activity going on in my room. I am here to let you know that I am worried that my students will not make the gains that they should or deserve to make because of the large class guys that I have this year. Second grade does two project-based learning activities. These projects require space for all students to collaborate. With 27 students in my small classroom, these projects would be very challenging. When the district decided to cut these group of students from four to three sections, the number of students was much lower. I alone have three students that are new to the district. Mrs. Fort has has three and Mr. Warren has three students that are new to our district. That is a total of nine students that were not accounted for when cutting this group from four to three sections. Again, I am here to advocate to advocate for my students. Please consider adding a fourth section of second grade to review. Making sure that my students get the education they deserve is why I they're teaching and I assume that is why you chose to be on the school board. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. second grade teacher, Nina Sport, from DO School Board members.

I'm here tonight to tell you that class sizes matter. We are asking that you either take action tonight or to make a plan to take action. So many of these players, no more physical space for you, so it's to come first. During the math we currently have seven more schools in second grade than the information"}, {"timestamp": [444.04, 605.44], "text": " you are provided with in August. If you were to add another teacher to second grade each classroom would have 20 students on which were manageable number to provide a world-class education to. I am certain you have all heard that there's no research supporting small class sizes yet at the the same time, it will also inform you that there's no research that supports large classroom sizes or even indicates that larger class sizes have positive effects on student learning. One of the ultimate goals of learning for students. I believe our goals are to ensure that all students have an equal chance to succeed, and that there are no gaps in academic or social growth. That being said, our students need the opportunity to learn and grow. They need both whole group and small group instruction. They need different unit instruction, individualized learning opportunities. They need positive relationships and focused attention. They want to shine as well as need to try and put that to situations as they need to rise. Large class sizes, every aspect of what our students need, let's focus on prioritizing what is truly important. Students need should always come first. Class size does matter, it matters to students, it matters to parents, it matters to teachers and just parents. Please make this a priority. This year there are far more interruptions, less space to learn with less time and opportunities for small groups and different human instruction. There is reduced to an engagement, less time for projects. My list could go on and on. With these examples, you can see that over product classrooms not only interfere with the quality of education so it's received, but also the frequency and duration of instruction. In my 17 years of teaching, this is a large classroom. Size, I have it ever experienced. And let me explain what I had to consider as a teacher coming in the school year. Where am I going to find two more tables and any more chairs to put in my classroom? Where are they going to fit? What am I going to find time to make meaningful connections with my students, each and every one of them and their families? When can I find time to meet with the ever-going needs of students? Where do I find extra time to teach you how to see any extra help"}, {"timestamp": [605.44, 608.96], "text": " or needing reticle of expected behaviors?"}, {"timestamp": [608.96, 612.28], "text": " And how can I possibly fit 27 peer teacher conferences"}, {"timestamp": [612.28, 614.8], "text": " in the 15 minutes slots that we have?"}, {"timestamp": [614.8, 618.6], "text": " Wait, there aren't enough slots for 27, parents to attend."}, {"timestamp": [619.44, 621.16], "text": " There's nine in here."}, {"timestamp": [621.16, 623.08], "text": " I'm gonna have to make something adjusting"}, {"timestamp": [623.08, 624.16], "text": " for conference times."}, {"timestamp": [805.88, 807.84], "text": " Thank you. Thank Bill. Thank you. Hi, I'm Colin Warren, 19th grade. I'm here to support them. What I was going to do is I was going to come up here and I was going to have 27 people come standing in front of you. We don't have 27 people here. We have 19, so we'd have to add more people. So you and then all those people come into that smaller area. That's our area to teach it. Some classes in the high school have 35. There's not enough seats for those students in here, including yours. That's too many kids. Now, I'm one of those guys that, hey, if you know what, I need to get it done. I got what I got. I'm gonna get it done. And that's how I felt until I saw a board meeting a couple of weeks ago and somebody who already heard this. Josh came up. He did his job. He said, hey, we have we have two coaches that are working with at least 20, 20 athletes, 20 athletes. I'm like, 20 athletes. I wish I only had 20 students. And you very quickly said, oh, yeah, he needs more. He needs more coaches more coaches you voted like this you looked around a little bit he had a little bit of discussion you asked some questions what's I appreciate but you basically said yeah well it sounds good to me well we can't just do a front so let's give them all to everybody Dr. Schmidt I'm walking watch and Dr. Schmidt he's like's like, we don't have the money for this. You could see it on his face. And I've seen that many times where you guys have voted on something and he's like, well, we really don't have the money to do it. But now we have enough coaches, but we don't have enough teachers. That's sad. When you go out to the community or you're going to sell people, hey, we don't have enough teachers, but we have plenty of coaches. Is that something you want to tell the community? I people that call me, I form my family as a family of teachers. They call me and they're like, what are they thinking? These are people in the community. These are people that live money to this school. Instead of people that you guys made promises to, that you're gonna have a good school for all children to learn. So if my request is simply, three things, please put the students first. I love our sports programs, but some of our sports programs are feasting and some of our classrooms are starving. Ask more questions. The highest paid guy in our school is sitting right there. You pay him a lot of money for a reason. Don't just ask him questions. He's willing to answer. I'm guessing he has all the answers because when we had our meeting the other day, some of the board members were like, well, we didn't know. Ask him. He has the answers for you. He's running a budget for you guys. Ask him questions that we create. And stop kicking the can down the road. Because this year, second grade has to many students. Next year, first grade and second grade are going to have to many students. Please ask questions of Dr. Schmidt. Please come to our classrooms and see what we're working with.

The public? Anybody? Okay. Move along. This time the consented jet deck. Can I get a motion to approve the consent agenda? I'm the motion. Which am I over dull? Squart? Squirt? Are you on any discussion? Yeah, I have a couple I want to pull. I'm going to start it from here. We're discussions. 4.8. Now, I'm going to eat it.8. 4.8. There. The discussion. And 4.15. 4.15. I guess that's it. All right, so we'll go ahead and we'll discuss it right now. 4.8. 4.8. Okay. I see Christy Nixon is twice on the consent agenda to hire her as a peron and then as a traffic control position. So first of all, five, unless I'm mistaken, I haven't seen that position of here on any of our agendaendas yet. Is that a new position? You are correct. You have not seen that on our agenda. Okay. And so, um, when we come into position, we usually have a job description. We usually have a board approves. I know under the consent agenda, we approve things, but when it's something new like this, a standalone discussion, I think it'd be more appropriate as a separate agenda, I know. But then a traffic control position, it will she be the only one at this point in time because I've been at the school, toward the end of school, and I see other employees directing traffic. So I was wondering if they were considered traffic control people. And they're getting $20 in power. That's my first question about traffic control. People, how many we have in your position? A couple things. First of all, we need somebody doing this, especially at the high school. You do have some other employees who are doing this. Some of them are just doing it free. They just want to do it. They just want to help out or just going out in some elementary schools, high school, and are just helping for periods of time. Sometimes it's all days a week, sometimes it's just some days a week. You need this position. We have done this before, where we have, and I've really admit, this is not listed and asked me under the wording like this. I'll change it. I'll call it something else, which is call it a parage job or something like that. Other duties as a site. In the short term, we need someone. well, I'm certainly be negotiating with Ask Me on this one as far as the position, but we think you're gonna need this position, long term, now that we've had some experience with the parking lots and flow and how people are moving and then out of the lot, we've gotten the bus's space to park, starting and ending times at Lorenci and in the high school. So that's better, but we still need somebody helping out on the traffic position. It doesn't have to be called this position. So that's just the position we call it right now. How would this person's position be different than the other ones that are directing traffic right now? Well, one is this person would be paid. You have other teachers who are doing this, they're not getting paid because they don't want to get paid. But they're, what they actually, we will do versus what this person, no matter what you call a traffic control person, we'll do. How will that be different than the ones who are volunteering their time? It's very, very similar. Okay. It's helping parents pick up kids, kids move, cars move in the right direction, so we don't get blockades keeping things moving, letting the buses go through. It really is very similar. Would this be like a half hour, the beginning of the day, and a half hour? No more than that. I don't want to ask. 20 minutes. There I think Mark Winters. There's a couple of things. I'm trying to add. I'm trying to add. Getting. Yeah. How many hours a day do I anticipate this being? I'm not even one. We're talking about 15 minutes before an hour. 20 minutes, something like that. Maybe half an hour under extreme circumstances. So this person would be getting $10 per day to come in the morning and come in the evening or after school? Come out for it. You know, I think that this one should be taken off the agenda and spoken about separately at a different point in time because is this considered a casual position? We don't have a job description. What about apps me? They may insist on it being negotiated in their contract. Could be an overload for somebody else. And so I think there are too many questions at this point in time to go ahead and improve it. In the meantime, we could probably just work with the volunteers that we have. And any others that would volunteer, but I think we just consider this one. There's a separate point in time and I would make a motion to remove that one from a consent agenda. And board members at this point they need to say you can do that you can say we'll consider that you have a problem right now and we have a solution for you to make it better you can certainly do it director, Director Sarcan, is asking that I'm just telling you, it's gonna be gummed up until we can get this something done. Well, my wife, I don't think you're gonna be gummed up because we've done without it for now. And if need be, maybe you could go out there and direct traffic to her, or at least in Mark Winter's head. But I'm saying this is more important than just passing it under consent agenda. I think we need to run it through ASME and consider if we are going to be asking us to hire more people like this or then will the other ones that are doing it voluntarily now say, oh well then maybe I should get money for this too. And are these teachers or ask me people or any other employees maybe they're administrative people? Are they leaving their jobs to go, you know, maybe their contact hours or their contractual hours to go to a traffic? I don't know, there's just too many things about it because it's something brand new. That's all right. I would agree both the ask me part. I would agree both that. But as you stated, because you had asked if somebody is going to come for $10 a day or whatever it was to do half hour in the morning and whatever you had mentioned. But the person that it looks like the person being hired to do that position is being hired as a pair professional as well and probably is just being paid extra time to stay later come earlier to fill that position. But I would agree about asking and having it run through AFS me first. You know, they have other pairs too that might may have wanted to do this for election money. And see, was this posted and advertised or how did this come about that I have I don't even know Christie Dixon and how it came about but maybe if we are going to have it maybe there are others that would have liked to have had it too I don't know how she was supposed to post all positions so this was posted to we got a stall position and this one was to we got a motion to remove this for future discussion. That was the second second by a coward doll We're discussion All some favors signify by saying aye Three three Three three goes nowhere three three Take a roll call. Yeah, okay, all right I didn. Okay. Here you are. Okay. There's four with four two. I apologize. Lisa, you said. Yeah. Here's a yes as well. Okay. All right. Okay. Part two. So we're going to. So a 4.8 has been removed for future discussion. Run it through. Ask me and see what they say. Okay. Very good. Paulie, 4.1. Yeah, well, along with the resignation letter came some, some concerns of this person in the position. And so I guess I would just maybe because it was brought to our attention now of this position and its job duties and the workload and whatever and how what we had before with less students and now we have more students and with less teachers and now we have more teachers for the The job description and the load of this position. I just I mean she's resigning so I we just I think this one too we need to take another look at this position to see if we wanted to make it more than a one person one position or 1.5 time at you know one and a half or one full time or whatever or so I'd like to reconsider this position and its duties with this resignation. So there wasn't a resignation letter in the board packet? There was, but it brought up some concerns about that position that I wasn't aware of, and probably other board members weren't. And when it comes to jobs and budget cuts or budget additions to their second grade staff or high school staff or science or any of our other math classes, we should consider this along alongside it to see if we want to make any change to this position. And did the job description change from when it was Virginia and Emma Gilbert and then when we combined and says that this position was the same work that two people once stayed in Virginia with less students and less. So I just like to be also this, along with, I know it's a little bit off topic, but with class sizes and additional staff for some of our elementary and our junior and senior high classes and courses. Whether it goes into a personal committee meeting or it comes back up at an export meeting or goes into negotiations I don't know. We've got the authority to add staff at any point in time and reductions in staff is a little bit different but I do think that it's off topic on what we're approving right now for the acceptance of the resignation. I mean, I agree the discussion that was brought up earlier could be brought to the personnel committee, but it was off topic. Go on with what we're voting on right now. You're right. It's the resignation we're voting on a consent agenda. There are things that are related to agenda items and consent agenda items."}, {"timestamp": [1505.6, 1525.16], "text": " And that I do think it's related and I do think we should have a discussion about it.

We went on to the reports. I've got Paul Peltier here from Ram, students, and discuss his organization is all about and how they can help our district. As members of the school board, the reason why Paul is up here, every once in a while, Steve George used to be the one coming up to give you an update about Cummings and going with Rams, because he does interact with a lot of different municipalities and other school districts, but also an addition for him to give you an update is for you to ask him. He loves answering questions. He loves back and forth discussions for this is not just a presentation from him, but here are opportunities to ask him any question and have a back and forth dialogue with him tonight. So that's the whole purpose of ways up there tonight. Thank you Dr. Schmidt. Chair, I need members of the board. My name is Paul Peltira. I'm the executive director of RAMS. RAM stands for the Ranged Association of Municipalities and Schools. You're probably quite familiar with that predecessor, Steve Georgian, Eater, Rocapina. I've been leading RAMS since July of last year, so about 15 months now coming up. And as a result of that, I'm kind of going around, talking to different stakeholder groups, putting the show on the road, so to say, and engaging and hopefully we'll turn into helpful dialogue about what the priorities of the Rockbridge School District are and how Rams can help. So have that at the back of your mind while we're discussing things today. I'm originally born in Hibbing, raised in Grand Rapids, went to Grand Rapids High School, we live in Virginia now, so this is our home district. So this is nice to kind of be here and be among you here today. I'm an educator by training. I'm a 15 year band inquire teacher. I'm a former coach swimming and I bring a lot of those skills and life experience to my work here at Rams. We represent 27 cities, 27 townships and 15 school districts all within the Takenite Assistance area. And for those of you who are somewhat familiar with that, I've included a map of where we are and where we find ourselves within that TAC and I assistance area. Rams has founded in Minnesota State Statute in 1939, in statute 471, and the boundaries were set at that time to include areas affected by mine. Rams is to support, protect, and defend, and coordinate with, and be the primary institute of civic government between cities, townships, and school districts within the TAA. So you'll see the school district boundaries on our map, indicate the boundaries of the TAC and I assistance area. So if you can see where all the mining facilities are, you can see where all the school districts are, where all the cities and townships and our Rams membership are. So as we go through this journey, you can refer back to that through the Lens Art Community work. Unlike public comment where you were not expected to or authorized really to have a backing forth this at this time we can't. So if you have any questions, feel free to jump in at any time. Ram serves 13,000 square miles, 153,000 people. One thing I would really put a fine point on is that any two random suburbs in the cities got a speed for population. So what do we do? We work together creatively with each other with our 69 local units of government or members of RAMS and together we pull our resources, we bring all of the good ideas together and we try and affect change across the state and especially for our region. We work with the entire legislative delegation of the range delegation to try and make good things happen at the Minnesota legislature and we work with our mayors, city councilors, school board members, township supervisors, county commissioners, everybody who's in local civic government up here to make good things happen for our local civic units of government. We are providing collaborative problem solving between and among these groups and with private industry. We are also authorized to establish a specific prioritized legislative agenda for the region and one of of the reasons that I'm here today is to share with you some of the legislative priorities we had last year, but also to ask what should we have on our priorities this coming year in 2025? We know that the legislative landscape certainly changed in November, and with that might come some opportunities or some challenges. So how would you like Rams to be positioning itself for the future with that school district lens specifically in mind? So I've included some of those items in your packet with you right now. We've got a list of kind of what happened a longer packet in all areas of legislation, not just the things that Rams had as priorities or just that affect the range, but all over. So if you're interested in what happened in transportation, interested in what happened in education funding, interested in what happened in outdoor recreation things, that's included in this packet. And also right underneath the map is our legislative priorities from 2024. And I won't go through those individually. You can see that they are mining focused, they are community focused, they are regional focused as well. Anything that ranges from EMS distributions, all the way to protecting local government aid and school subsidy treatments. So you can see that the work of RAM is quite varied and establishes itself as one of those organizations that's interested in all of the things. So really, if it affects life on the range in any way, shape or form, whether it's housing, child care, school, funding, local government services, we are interested in it because it truly affects everything. And as you know from your budget and fiduciary duties as a school district, what happens at the county, what happens at the state? Sometimes affects you often affects what happens at the school district level. So understanding how all of these items work together is part of translating what happens in the work of Rams. And as a former teacher, I've got two posted notes right above my desk at my office right now in Rams. One of them says, this is teaching, and the other one says this ain't teaching. And all of my work fits one of those two buckets. Sometimes it's teaching about the range, sometimes it's teaching about a region that people don't know about, especially when I'm talking to folks in St. Paul or even just outside of our range area. And other times it is not teaching. It has to do with Wheeling and Dealing and trying to make some collaborative efforts across the region, breaking down barriers and decilaming our communities when you would almost never have gone to another town in some generations, right? Well now we're realizing that we need each other more than ever before and we are truly stronger together. The tagline for Rams is one range, one voice, and truly what that means for me is when we all work together, we have a stronger voice both at the capital and among each other across the region. Some of the issues that we work on, my mission is to connect, communicate and advocate on issues ranging very widely from broadband. You kind of know if you live out in the hinterlands, it's not easy to get broadband. Led Rock is a real thing. And I taught through COVID. A lot of you were here during that time. Some of the same kids who had to go to McDonald's parking lot in Chisholm would have to go there again because the broadband just isn't out there for them right now. So, you've seen that struggle in your own communities and you've kind of fought that fight. We continue to make broadband a priority for the region because we connect providers with communities and townships that are really interested in that. So if you know anyone interested in that space, please connect me. We're very interested in housing because you can't chase projects and economic development until you chase people and so if you have a declining enrollment of school or a population what does that mean? How can we provide opportunities for creative housing projects? In 2023 the Minnesota legislature allocated a basically unicorn amount of money in 1.3 billion dollars towards housing one time. How much of that money is coming north and how are we ready for that? So we're in dialogue with our mayors, our city councils, about what their municipal structure is, about what they're able to do to contribute to the housing shelter right now. We again develop a set of legislative priorities and most recently I released a legislative survey, Superintendent Schmidt should have received that along with others and feel free to share that with your board and have them fill it out if you wish. But we're soliciting input in a way that we've never done before. What is important to your district? Please share that by the end of the week that we've fantastic. One of the really important things that didn't happen last year was a bonding project. We had no municipal bonding for the state of Minnesota and that was an epic failure of local government because a lot of projects just got a lot more expensive. And so one of the things that we're looking for next year is what are the priorities around bonding? We know that school districts on the range are specifically benefiting from the TACONITE production tax. Rockbridge alone gets $3.7 million from TACONITE production tax. And that's money you don't have to ask for, bond for, levied for, or anything like that. It's a unique benefit of our local property taxes being returned to the district from where they came from. It's a really important thing to understand how mining affects our region. Another thing we have to educate on when we go outside of the IR range, because people don't naturally understand that item. The very last document that I have on the back of that legislative thing is a harder card version of school trust lands. You heard Dr. Schmidt, I think probably two or three board meetings ago, bring up the U.S. Forest Service letter on school trust lands in the boundary waters. And I want to focus on specifically the blue sheet, the back of the packet that I handed you. It kind of is a, are you a trust fund baby? Well, that's not a weird, but it's the school trust. Every school kid in Minnesota gets at their district level, $57 per kid. Right now in Rackbridge, that's about $127,000, $137,000. Again, you don't have to bond for it, levied for it, ask for it, ever. It is established by the founding fathers of Minnesota to make sure that we had in perpetuity money set aside for education. What a gift, okay? It's $137,000. It's not a billion dollars, but it's something and you'd notice it like if it was gone, okay? Just as a point of information, that document will get updated probably every two years. So what you have right now is probably the document they're gonna roll through. Be happy to discuss school trust lands with you. It's a very interesting topic. We have an annual dinner coming up. I'm December 19th at the Iron Trail Motors Event Center. It's open to all board members. You are included in that as well as you are members of RAMS. It's a free dinner to all board members within the RAMS service area. We'll be electing new board members to the RAMS board. The RAMS board is made up of 24 elected officials. Now you have seven on your board, but we have 24 on our board. So we have people everywhere who will care about the Iron Range and our Northern Minnesota communities that come together to discuss the regional importance of the things that we care about and how we can carry those messages forward. Nominations will be due by the end of November, and I'll be sending that information out to Dr. Schmidt and he can circulate that for your consideration. So if you're interested in serving on the RAMS board, 11 roll off every year in a two-year cycle. So 11-1 here, 11-1 there, and then we have two appointed superintendents from the Superintendents Association. So as a former educator, being at a school, I talk a lot. And as an extroverted band teacher, I'm really good at running this room. But now it's your turn. What are the priorities for rockridge school district? How can Rams be helpful? What can I help as far as your priority? Any questions for Paul? When did for one, when did you say nominations or do? It'll be at the end of November. You're trying for the Rams Board seats. Yeah. I'm actually glad you're here, Paul, because, well, number one, I didn't know your band and choir teachers, so that's not to learn. But I really didn't know much about rams. So getting some information, I feel like is super beneficial. I had a question, but I lost it. I have to think about it again. You think of it. You think of it jumping at any time? Yeah. I have a couple questions. So the school board members on RAMS, when you talk about legislative initiatives and lobbying and everything, do you have subcommittees? I mean, I used to belong to RAMS, but I think it's changed for a long time. It's changed since a long time ago. But do they do you have like an education committee that comes up and promotes or provides or gives direction to school things and then are those board members directly in contact with their board to get those because just had like the Minnesota school and the impact their legislative platform too. And we as boards can and we're asked to, I think the deadline is gone now to submit for their legislative platform. So I'm thinking of something pattern like that for ramps. Do you have that? Sure. So one of our great strengths is we've got distributed leadership all throughout the committees of ramps. We have an executive committee that functions primarily as a personnel committee. We don't get really tied up in the superstructure of all of these different diverse types of committees. That if someone has an idea, they're free to bring it at any point in time. And we generally discuss things, cards on the table at our board meetings. Like we don't have any secret backroom deals or anything like that."}, {"timestamp": [2385.68, 2387.2], "text": " We just lay it all out there."}, {"timestamp": [2387.2, 2390.96], "text": " We have interested parties who are interested in various types of legislation"}, {"timestamp": [2390.96, 2393.44], "text": " that certainly give us our input at the time-room request."}, {"timestamp": [2393.44, 2397.84], "text": " And so our boards go out and they solicit that information and bring it back to us."}, {"timestamp": [2399.36, 2401.76], "text": " So we bring it back to the full group."}, {"timestamp": [2401.76, 2402.24], "text": " Yep."}, {"timestamp": [2402.24, 2527.8], "text": " And to do a special timing of the year that you have your membership suggest.

And then we will then aggregate that and then the full board will chew on those results. We'll share those information with the board in the survey results at the next board meeting. And we will take that on our advisory and approve a set of legislative priorities as the entire grant board. So this one that says legislative update may have 2024. This is the pet what happened in the past. This is what happened in general across the entire Minnesota legislation. Yes and then so this one with the red and the first three involve schools. And so you just have a survey form that you send out. Yes, I have a municipal survey and a education survey. So. And I'll school board just get that or just. All of the superintendents receive that and what they choose to do with that is their business after that for me. I'm not going to tell them to send it to their specific members. If they choose to fill that out, is the contact point that sort of can be an item presented to site. How frequently does the Rams board meet? So we meet monthly. And so we meet on the fourth Thursday of the month with the exception of some holidays. And we have a website, Ramsmmn.org. You can find a lot of information. I think probably in a couple of months, we're gonna be reorganizing that around our priority areas of broadband, housing, education, local government. And so I'm looking forward to kind of going to that editing process and kind of honing the tip of the spear on that. Yeah. I remember my question, which was Brandy's question, but are you, are your meetings just open to the public then? They're not closed. We, we, that the Northeast Service call up unless posted otherwise and, and members and public alike are able to attend. Yeah. What's your funding call? Some of it legislated and then, uh, some of it by membership fees from. Yeah, so the good question.

Yep. The funding too. I remember. All right. Thank you. You're welcome. Any more questions for Paul? Just to reiterate if you had said if we had any ideas legislatively we could by the end of the week give it to Dr. Schmitt. Yes. We're at any other time. All of you have a card with my personal cell phone number on it. I mean, I feel like I should probably just put it on Facebook every day or something like because everybody in their brothers got my number. But just know that the phone's always on, the email's always open. You can reach out to me any time on any issue whether it's a big deal or a small deal or a front, I don't know you. Just lay it out there and I'll try my best to connect you with the people that can help get you the answer that you need and be an advocate for the region. I'm your person here. It's on the ground. I live here at work here. My kids go to school here. Three other teachers are in the room today. So it's like we're connected to the community we serve and it's a privilege. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Well thank you for having me and please don't Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for having me. Please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks. Thank you. Next is 5.2. Which is now me. This is June Representative's report. We're going to have a discussion on meet and confer in this committee update. Sorry, she's not. I'm very excited. So the call can help me because I was running a little late from work that day. So I was a little bit late in discussing some of the items. But I do have notes. And again, I was doing my best to listen to what they have to say at the end about the class sizes and concerns about that. I think get a ton of notes at the end. But our agenda involved PSEO discussion on that. I got came a little bit late. So Nicole might be able to provide more information on that. Essentially, teachers were looking at the numbers as we have leaving and attending college versus being on campus. And they're wondering about how to go about keeping and retaining those students. And they were wondering if they could kind of take the lead in bringing us some solutions to the problem. They did have some when they came, but they're going to kind of take the lead and then come discuss it with the school board, right? Yeah, yeah, thank you. So I'll basically, yeah, they're looking for creative kind of solutions to keep, because there's so many, especially it wasn't like a lot of grade, there's just a lot of kids that are doing that. And so looking at creative solutions to retain kids, basically. Like flexible scheduling type things. You know, to make it more appealing for kids to stay here. Right. The other thing that was on the agenda was discipline and I'm happy to report it sounded like all of the buildings are pleased with how the school year has that they're discipline. They have a behavior matrix that they're utilizing. They have some forms they're utilizing as well. That's helping with communication and just overall with the management of behaviors. So that was positive. And also administration is more visible in the hallways and they feel better supported. Support was the word I was looking for. Sure. They feel things are more consistent. They feel more supported. And again, like I said, more visibility by administration. Kids that are being destructive are being removed immediately and they're returning when they're calm. There's different levels of the matrix system. Level one, level two and level three. Everyone can see documentation. They're having reentry meetings, positive door greetings. When students are coming in, everyone's out in the halls, all the teachers are out in the halls. And again, the administration is walking the floors. Did I miss anything? I think you got it. I think there was a lot of the biggest thing that I took away, the communication. Everybody was on the same page, and everyone was, you know, it just seemed to be going really well. I was really actually surprised, happily surprised. Yeah. That it was such a good conversation about that. Yeah, and I had school staff share with me two of the matrix and some of those forums so that I could kind of see what was going on too. So looked really good. There was a discussion about student art in costas and being a third level one, a third level two, a third level three. It was pointed out that no one's art is being excluded, but just kind of looking at the type of art that's being put up in kind of a creative thinking type things. Sound good, Noel? Yep. And where art can be displayed, especially in like the new North. Yeah. There was also going to be a discussion on coaches transporting students. We didn't end up talking about that. We didn't end up talking about that, but there was just concerns about I think liability, if I remember that's why I think that's why I think that's why I think that's why I think that's why I think that's why I think that's why I think that's why I think that's why I think that's why I think that's why I think that's why I think that's why I think that's why I think that's why I think that's why I think that's why I think that's why I think that's why I think that's why I think that's why I think that's why I think that's why high numbers and we as board members that were there stated you know we've always we've always prioritized having small classes and you know, we all have gotten on the board. I would say we've all gotten on the board because we want to do what's best for students and support teachers and and provide opportunities. So again, it was brought up and I think they summarized a little bit too when they spoke earlier during visitor input, but just about the amount of space in there, like if they were to have, you know, we want to invite parents in and have them see what we're doing in the classrooms and they had said that, you know, if you're going to do that with 27 kids in the class and each of them are bringing parents, you know, that's a lot of people in one classroom, not a whole lot of room. You know, and students are smushed into the classrooms. It doesn't allow, there is, they didn't focus on this, but you know, when you've got discipline, things in the classroom too, it makes it really hard when you've got larger numbers. And the point was made about conferences, how do you put them into time slots when you have that many kids? You're not even at conferences long enough to do that. The budgets came up a boat, classroom budgets not being as equal to sports budgets. That was brought up as well. We encouraged staff, because staffs had asked, where would you like us to go with our concerns? Do we go to our building admin? Do we come to the school board? What would you like to see? And we had to encourage them to communicate their needs with their building admin because they are there to advocate for their staff too. And then we also encourage them to attend budget and finance committee meetings for things like these discussions about staffing, about teachers. They did say that there's plenty of room at the park view for another second grade classroom. I had asked that question. So there's space there to allow for that. A lot of discussion surrounding the class sizes and student needs and what we can do as it was brought up earlier during our during the consent agenda, I do think that bringing these things to the personnel committee would be a great start. The other thing that was said to is having those quarterly meeting confirm meetings has really been helpful for all of us to kind of communicate with each other, work with each other, collaborate and find out what's working, what's not working, just kind of approach it in the positive, open-minded team effort. Proactive. Proactive. Yes. Can I cover it? Yeah I think you did excellent. Yeah I really appreciate them meet and confer because we don't we're not in the classroom we don't know so we only hear what we hear and it's just so nice to be able to because we we want to help we want to be an advocate and for teachers and students and staff and we want to make sure that you know we're doing right by the district and so sometimes you know we all have full-time jobs or whatever so we're not there. The teachers are there and it's just really nice to be able to hear the concerns and the good things too that are working and hopefully support that. But I do what you did a great job. You went over pretty much everything."}, {"timestamp": [3145.0, 3206.0], "text": " And I do think that we really should, we really need to talk about the class sizes and probably especially that young, absolutely age-level. That was really disturbing and something that I am disappointed by, didn't know. I think when we talked about the budget, I felt like, I mean, it's kind of a whirlwind because you gotta get a lot of information, but I felt like that wasn't part of like class sizes. Like, I don't feel like they're, until they're gonna be that big. And so, and I think that in all fairness, I think that from start of school year, you have no, you know, you have no gauge on how many kids are going to transfer in or I mean maybe, maybe history, but you just never know how many are going to be moving into the district because it sounds like there's still kids moving in, you know, each week. um into our district and into our classrooms and overloading their classrooms and they"}, {"timestamp": [3206.0, 3245.38], "text": " the other thing that they had brought up was about having a cap, you know, could we have a cap on the number of students in classrooms? I think that should be discussed in the person. I said, no, I do. And maybe it's more of a loose cap because I hard I don't know"}, {"timestamp": [3405.0, 3445.6], "text": " You could discuss it in the personal well because what happened was they ended up getting nine students that we didn't know about right So a loose cap might have prevented, you know That to be happening And I think you know you brought up the teachers brought up a few times like oh, there's no study about you about low class sizes or high class sizes, but I think common sense will tell you big class sizes at elementary level are not good. And I as a board member, that's really important to me. I want to keep them smaller. I think that's way too big for a second grade. I don't like that at all. And I don't think those parents would be happy that either. So what I mean I have to ask the question what is the comparison from part view to the wrench and say fourth grade I mean with the class sizes. We had some numbers this summer but that was before school started and I know we make October first reports to the state. Maybe we could could and get an update to how that, since school started and now that things are settling down, and especially now our specific required head counts to the state, that would give us a better idea. Was there any other discussion about class sizes and sciences and math? There was some discussion about high school as well. I want to say there was some English, because I believe it was Jill Clinton that had brought it up to. One other thing that did come up in the class sizes discussion is transportation of students, you know, like if they were to choose to go to the Laurentian, but their Virginia side, just kind of how that all works out. Or if we could say you're over there, you have to go there, that kind of thing, even if parents are. But I think maybe if you have a loose cap, then that, you know, the first comment's like actual, you know, students that live in that particular town, maybe, I don't know, that's an idea. And then until we get to that, a loose cap or whatever. Yeah. To last the question again, what is the comparison between Parkview and Laurentian? Well, you had it in your board meeting just a couple of board meetings ago. But they might be probably have changed them. They've changed a little bit, but they're more similar because you've also lost some kids here too. Okay, so they're pretty much within a couple. Yeah, they're not that different from what you saw a couple. I always want to agree with that. Second grade number is 66 which means there's 22 in a class. I learned. I learned. I learned. Okay and then that was that was one grade again, Shane. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second. Second grade class in Parkview has 27 27. 27. Three sections at 27 each. How many sections at Laurentian? It's a three. Three to four. Three to three. There's a one class sample for section. No, there are three across the board. So, is that a great class of"}, {"timestamp": [3445.6, 3447.44], "text": " Laurentian that's got the big numbers or something."}, {"timestamp": [3449.08, 3449.88], "text": " I'm right."}, {"timestamp": [3450.24, 3454.56], "text": " I mean, maybe, maybe you hate to go back and revisit this, but maybe the attendance"}, {"timestamp": [3454.56, 3457.92], "text": " followed you.

Who are you asking? Well, I was asking Shayna and I'm well. It would remember years ago when they did the study, what will happen is if you do that, you will overload Laurentian. Okay, all right. You won't have room for it. Okay, right. That's why, and the midway kids at that time, the parents wanted them to go to part field. I thought the wrenching would have been about 90, 95% full, but not that we wouldn't have a new room. It would be full, but we have. Well, it depends on your definition of full list. Those classes would have been loaded. You would have had 25, 26, 27, 28. And on the other side of Virginia, you'd be lucky at 19, 20, 21, 22s. Well, it was last year we had the teachers from Laurentian, saying they had over loaded. I want to say it was second grade. I think so too. That was overloaded last year at the Laurentian. That's what I was thinking too. And you're going to get two years ago. Two years ago. It's going to happen. It's just one of the kings that they have to work on and it sounds like Parkview is in need of another teacher of the kind of resource class sizes which what they're saying. But anyway, I'm off topic a little bit Kind of well, it's a it's about we're talking or discussing what happened up in the New York. And we're all that class sizes were part of that. Anderson the board if this can't do, we'll bring all of this to the personnel committee Class sizes everything what you've heard here and we'll go from there. So was was there an actual agenda for this? Yes, yes, she was. Brandy went over the agenda. Yeah, so I know, but online it just says I'm making conferred. They provided they provided us the name for they typically the day before the meet confer meeting. They'll send us an email on what they would like to have discussed. Yeah, we probably should post that on board. And then did the board have any meeting conferred items because we can, you know, we did not. Maybe as a board to continue the committee the next discussions on what they have. And I see I see you scheduled ones into next year too. Yeah, I think more of that we can all be thinking."}, {"timestamp": [3606.64, 3609.68], "text": " There might be meet conferred items from the school district"}, {"timestamp": [3609.68, 3611.36], "text": " and board site too."}, {"timestamp": [3611.36, 3612.2], "text": " The break."}, {"timestamp": [3612.2, 3613.96], "text": " That's legislative too."}, {"timestamp": [3613.96, 3614.8], "text": " Right."}, {"timestamp": [3615.84, 3620.84], "text": " Okay, so 5.2, which was changed over to committee updates."}, {"timestamp": [3622.12, 4346.6], "text": " Was there any other committee updates? Goatations? Yes. What day was that? Board members, what happened? The school board negotiations committee did meet to talk about individual contracts. They made some recommendations. So we are talking to individual people. You have a number of folks who are on individual contracts. Certainly everybody in this role right here. And so we will bring those numbers to you and what those recommendations were at the next board meeting. So you can see what every single one of those recommendations was. So what is our actual negotiation session? Rehend, the go-shade top? Nope. We met for, we met to discuss how we were gonna negotiate with those individual contracts, which lasted like about 15 minutes. Okay, so there was, because we weren't gonna do it like we did last time where everybody came to us. We were gonna take a different approach to it. Okay, so there was no cross the table, no go sheet, but then. So there will be, there will be there, or what will the next step be? What's that? What will the next step be? Noel said you board me some recommendations. Not the board, the board. That can board me. Okay, the board committee. Made some recommendations for the individual contracts. Yep. And so what happened to those recommendations? So we are talking to the individual people involved about what those recommendations were. And then at the next floor meeting, I'll bring to you what all of those specific recommendations were with the exact dollar figures and everything, the next floor meeting. So you can see what those recommendations work. But when will when will the input from the individual contracting police come in? At this point the committee recommended to not do that right now. You are asking any event to sign contracts at this point in time? No. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. out. Yeah, that's okay. Almost a year. Yeah. Good evening board members. I come to you a month and half here in to school. School's off to a great start at Parkview. I wanted to let you know when I looked just briefly a few minutes here about our ads and drops. and I know you're talking about student numbers, we're holding study. We actually, we from day one until today, in K through two, we have gained 10 kids in last five, so we're up five, but we're holding pretty steady. What you're hearing from my staff is, yes, we are gaining. We have three new students just start today. We're not seeing that in-fucks because we're also losing students that are going moving out of stage or whatever. So we're not seeing the numbers climbing every other grade level but in second grade they have climbed because we gained more students there. Otherwise they'll be off to a great start. All of our classes have started. And I mean that in terms of all of our early childhood, our ECFD classes, all of those extra things that usually start a little bit later into the year. They've all started now. They're going really well. In fact, ECFD has a carnival or a fall festival, I should say, coming up next Thursday, the 24th from five to six 30 for all ECFB families within our Rockridge district. It is held at the Laurentian this time. I know that through that program, they try to do them between the Laurentian and the Parkview. So this one's held at the Laurentian, but that's coming up to get that nice little fault festival for those little's in. At Perfew, our PTA did put on a ball festival or a ball carnival. I should say, as kind of a fundraiser, they chose not to do a send home go sell things fundraiser, but we held a carnival and all of our teachers and staff so graciously donated. Some time they came and ran a little carnival game and the kids bought some Punch tickets to go through the games and win some little prizes and things and It was a hit. It was a hit for all of the kids and the families. A couple nights or a couple hours I should say of a fun in one night and we're done. And it was a great fundraiser for our PTA. So like I said, the kids, kids had a lot of fun with that too. I would like to give a shout out to the local fire departments. They have been doing the last couple of years a collaboration of all the fire departments. So, Moman Air and Evelyn, Gilbert, Virginia, Fail have been coming together to do fire safety at the different local districts and buildings together so that they can hit all of the classes and really give them a nice showing of the trucks and things like that. So that happened at Parkview today this morning for all of our kids. So they had fun with that. As far as things coming up, I know I mentioned that ECFE Fall Festival Festival. Our part crew teachers were invited to do Make Teacher Night at McDonald's. So I expect to see all of you eating your lovely separate McDonald's of the 24th, because 10% of our proceeds from that night will be donated back to the Perkview. So on Thursday from 4 to 7, October 24thth you can come and see your favorite Perkview staff working at McDonald's and get some food to donate some of those proceeds back. So we're pretty excited about that. I know I did it many years ago and we had a lot of fun and the kids just love to see us. the staff and teachers working there. So we also have our harvest party coming up on the 31st of October for our students during the day. The PT puts that on. They have little games for them as well on that day. And our few conferences are November 12th and 14th and I won't be back before that. So I'm going to bring them up that we will be meeting with our families at 12th and 14th of November. And that is all I have for you tonight. I want to see your questions for me. Don't. Any questions? OK. Thank you. Thank you, Shina. Thank you. Thank you, Shina. Up next is the superintendent report. Thank you, director Eddie. A couple things to update the board on. The first thing is before I get the superintendent goes is, we do have school board elections coming up, and what will be happening that will be a school board candidate forum, and that will be on Monday, October 21st at 6 p.m. It will be held here in the admin building and the students are running the show. They have done this before in the past. They are running the School Board Canada forum and it is an opportunity for people who are running for a school board to express their views and so folks can know how they feel about various topics and also for the other way for people to understand and ask candidates in here how can it where the candidates are. We as a school district, we are not running it. We're agnostic on that as far as who's on the school board. The community votes the school board members in. I've worked with I think over 23 school board members over the last eight, nine years. So whoever the public selects, that's who the governing board is for the Rackford School Board. But there is an opportunity to meet the candidates and we will do exactly what we do for all the school board meetings. We will record it. So if you're watching on camera tonight, you can show up and watch it live, or you can watch it on YouTube, or we will also keep the video, so you can also go to our social media or website, and take a look at it and watch it at your leisure. But just want to give you a heads up that that is coming up. Second thing is that I brought the superintendent goals up the last meeting we had. I don't know if I need to go through them again one by one like I did last time. I did get some feedback. I modified some of the goals based upon the feedback I got them But they're there and I guess I'm asking for one last round of feedback. If any board member has them, otherwise I will start implementing them. So is there any last feedback that any member of the board would want on my goals for 2425. On how about attending the more local superintendant meetings? Is that any sort of a goal? It is not. I can add that one because I don't have nearly as much construction meetings as I used to have. Okay. Yep. I will add that one. Just so there you know you're part of those discussions with local superintendents and then just you know making sure your visibility is at all the buildings so everybody is used to seeing you walking, walking in the hallways and I think that's on there. I'm looking and I can see it. Please. Talk to the classroom. Number eight. Number eight. Yeah. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Okay. That was just in for today. Yeah. And super visibility. Are you talking about the region 27, 26, 27 or 28? Are you talking about the superintendant meetings? Because there's also, we still belong to this, and I'll see. And, uh, Absolutely. What happened because we had three buildings on a construction. I miss a lot of those meetings because they were at the same time We had construction meetings because my first obligation and loyalty is to the school district Not necessarily to all of the area superintendents So that's where I spent my time, but now the construction meetings have tailed way off. They're literally done almost So yes,, I will add that director Lottiger as a goal. Thank you. And do we get, I know we don't get them, but I've been interested in those superintendent meetings. You must have a jet does. You have regular meetings. And what about minutes of those meetings? Love a superintendent meeting. Minutes are kept. I get minutes of those meetings. I know, but we don't get them mess board members. You know? No, would you like me to pass them on to you? Yeah, I would. Not a secret. Because I would have been over to a little bit off topic. We used to get the minutes of, you know, rams and those other organizations we belong to. But they seemed to have kind of petered out. And I was obviously. But you belong to a number of groups that, do you want all of these minutes? You want to men? I know. It might just be me. Okay. I am curious on what the discussions are locally with superintendents and what you know what are issues and I agree with that. I think yeah, I think we know what's going on. Can do it. Yes, we'll do and And there's rams. There's arc. There's whatever. You want all of them? Well, I could go on the website if they're posted. That's a surprise. I mean, I may not be posted. But I don't know where I've been. We used to have EIP and ask the fuck not with. But I don't think that you have them online for the supers. No, and then the agendas."}, {"timestamp": [4347.1, 4348.6], "text": " I think whatever's not online."}, {"timestamp": [4351.3, 4353.8], "text": " That would be the 2728 super tenants."}, {"timestamp": [4353.8, 4355.2], "text": " The others are I think are all online."}, {"timestamp": [4355.2, 4355.8], "text": " You can get them."}, {"timestamp": [4356.5, 4356.9], "text": " Okay."}, {"timestamp": [4357.0, 4357.5], "text": " Can do."}, {"timestamp": [4357.7, 4358.2], "text": " Yeah."}, {"timestamp": [4358.4, 4358.9], "text": " Thank you."}, {"timestamp": [4360.6, 4361.9], "text": " And that is it."}, {"timestamp": [4364.0, 4445.76], "text": " Moving along to the Chess and report.

Five. Five, one. Five, one. Five, four. One. Okay. The policy is you're the first reading. I'm going to make a suggestion that we, the first reading that we go from six, one to six point42 in a blanket first reading. So moved. Sport. Okay. So by Sarkin and my loud a girl in discussion. I was just looking for clarification earlier on the color of changes in red as I believe MSB the changes in the changes in the changes in the changes in the changes in the changes in the changes in the changes in the changes in the changes in the changes in the changes in the changes in the changes in the changes in the changes in the changes in the changes in the for the Canadian. and we there's really two colors.

Red is MSPA is making a suggestion. Okay. And this is just the first reading. Okay. So we got motion by a certain support by a lot of her to blanket policy to approve all six one through 6.42. All those in favor signify by saying aye. Aye. Opposed? Motion passes unanimously. Moving along. Move the administrative items. 7.1. Consider submitting a nomination for the Northeast Service Corrupt. Board of Directors that it is looking to fill three school board representative positions. Okay, now this is not something you vote on. It was just they're just looking for a nomination. So because Tim is already on and he's not up until 2026, do we even, does this even apply to us? Probably not, I think. Maybe not, but you got it and so we wanted you to see it. Okay, so we can just take no action on this, I believe. Okay. And because if we had a nomination from somebody from another district, we would want to do that. We knew that that person was open to us, right? So I think that would be good to take no action. Okay. So we'll move on to 7.2. Consider the proxy statement from the Minnesota School Board's Association Insurance Trust. Again on this, you know, it's pretty much we have a choice we can just vote vote both the suggested ones or just don't vote for anybody We don't even know these people I guess it doesn't So we do have a choice vote for the nominees listed or do not vote for the nominees listed. What's what's the board want to do? I'll move that we just don't vote for anybody. Take no action. I would second that. Okay. It's not taking any action. We have two action choices on the last page there. We just don't vote for any of the nominees. Okay, so then 7.3 is going to be the same. I believe. Yeah, that's right. 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, we just won't take any action. But I'll read 7.3 to the public to consider the proxy statement from the Minnesota School District Liquid Asset Funds Plus. All right. No, well, do we partake in either one or both of these insurance trusts and the liquid asset asset? All right. We'll move along to eight. Meeting announcements eight, point one, this school will candid in forum. We'll be scheduled Monday, October 21st, 2024, at 6 p.m. here in the Rockridge Administrative Building. Our next regular meeting will be October 28th at 6 p.m. here in the Rockridge Administrative Building. At this point, I would ask for a motion to adjourn."}, {"timestamp": [4666.0, 4667.0], "text": " So moved."}, {"timestamp": [4667.0, 4668.0], "text": " I'll second."}, {"timestamp": [4668.0, 4669.0], "text": " I'll be very supportive by"}, {"timestamp": [4669.0, 4670.0], "text": " Alberto."}, {"timestamp": [4670.0, 4672.0], "text": " I'll be favorited by you saying hi."}, {"timestamp": [4672.0, 4673.0], "text": " Hi."}, {"timestamp": [4673.0, null], "text": " I'll be pleased to ask the unanimous. you"}]
